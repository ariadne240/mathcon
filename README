A pretheory consists of two parts. The first part is for wf-verifier.
The second part is for pf-verifiers and can have multiple functions.
A common example is like this:
#(
You can use comments by writing memos in #( #).
#)
#1
wf :: String -> Bool
#2
pf1 :: [String] -> Bool
pf2 :: [String] -> Bool
pf3 :: [String] -> Bool

STEP 0: Pretheory Speculation -> Pretheory (plugin1)
STEP 1, Registration: Pretheory -> Theory (register In main)
STEP 2, Theory Setting: Theory -> Usable (setth In main)
STEP 3, Usable Employment: Usable -> Interact
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
plugin2 for metatheorems (rulec, ...)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile "main", do:
ghc -o main main.hs -igenlib
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metatheorems for proof theory
Metatheorems for model theory

There is a hidden folder: .hiddenplace
You can see it by 'ls -a' command.
What can we do with .hiddenplace?
We can put pretheories we want inside 'pretheory' folder.
And we can interpret the pretheory by transforming it to a theory.
When we want special features to do with theories, we have to build a
uber-pretheory which holds more information than normal theories.
If we want a plenty of features, we need to save a text file for
a pretheory. After it, we choose the way of interpretation in 'main',
which means that we automatically build a 'theory' in folder '.hiddenplace'.
And after this, we can use rich features in it by putting commands to the
terminal in 'main'.
For this, we need a revolutionary change in the structure of whole folder.
