<h1>Welcome to Mathcon</h1>
<p>
Let us construct mathematics again &mdash; on our own.
</p>
<h2>Founded</h2>
<p>
This program follows the standard development of modern logic and foundation of mathematics. It has straightforward concepts and motivations.
</p>
<h2>Flawless</h2>
<p>
Every process of proof is verified by a machine. You can insert a possible proof and find whether it has errors.
</p>
<h2>Automated</h2>
<p>
The program automatically verifies proofs on specific axiom systems. All you have to do is to wait.
</p>
<h2>Plain</h2>
<p>
There are no complications in using the program. There are plenty of plugins to help you to write down the theories and proofs of theorems.
